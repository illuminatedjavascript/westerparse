The WesterParse Project
=======================

This project implements the theory of tonal music presented in chapters 4-6 of 
*An Introduction to Tonal Theory* (New York: Norton, 1975) by Peter Westergaard.

There are two main components: a *parser* that evaluates the structure of 
musical lines used in species counterpoint, and a *checker* that evaluates the
voice leading of species counterpoint compositions. 

Westergaard's innovative contribution to the pedagogical discipline of species 
counterpoint was the formulation of a syntax for contrapuntal lines and an explication 
of the cognitive issues involved in how listeners parse the syntax of such lines. 
Hence the name of this program, **WesterParse**.
