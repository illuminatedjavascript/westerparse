The web interface was created by Stephen Pentecost, Senior Digital 
Humanities Specialist at Washington University in St. Louis.  

The user can create compositions of one, two, or three lines.  After completing a
composition, the user can have each line evaluated by WesterParse.  The result
is displayed beneath the music.  For example:

:literal:`PARSE REPORT
Key inferred by program: C major
The line is generable as a primary line but not as a bass line.`
