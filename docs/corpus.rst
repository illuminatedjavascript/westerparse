The WesterParse Corpus
======================

[Instructions for using the corpus of examples, including many examples 
drawn from Westergaard's book.]

Requires Tkinter, PIL, and MuseScore.

>>> viewer.py

Select a corpus to view: either lines or counterpoint.

Select a file in the list. The music will automatically display in the bottom panel.

If the file is a single line, you may select what line type to evaluate. 
Choose 'any' to get all of the possible parses.

If the file is counterpoint, you may choose either to evaluate the counterpoint or 
display the the linear syntax (i.e., the parses of the lines). If you choose to display
the syntax, be patient, as it takes several seconds for MuseScore to generate the image
files that will be displayed onscreen.

Reports on parsing and voice leading will be displayed above the music.
