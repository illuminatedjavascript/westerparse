<p><strong>Rules of Basic Structure</strong></p>
<p><em>Primary Lines</em> with a basic step motion</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>S1. The final pitch in the basic step motion must be a tonic pitch.</p></li>
<li><p>S2. The first pitch in the basic step motion must be a tonic-triad member a third, fifth, or octave above the final pitch.</p></li>
<li><p>S3. These two pitches must be connected by a descending diatonic step motion.</p></li>
</ul>
<p><em>Bass Lines</em> with a basic arpeggiation</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>S1. The final pitch of the basic arpeggiation must be a tonic.</p></li>
<li><p>S2. The first pitch of the basic arpeggiation must be a tonic.</p></li>
<li><p>S3. The middle pitch of the basic arpeggiation must lie a fifth above or a fourth below the final pitch of the basic arpeggiation.</p></li>
</ul>
<p><em>Generic Lines</em></p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>S1. The final pitch of the basic arpeggiation must be a tonic.</p></li>
<li><p>S2. The first pitch of the basic arpeggiation must be a tonic.</p></li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Rules of Elaboration</strong></p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>E1. Any tonic-triad pitch may be repeated, but not the pitch generated by S1.</p></li>
<li><p>E2. A neighbor note may be inserted between consecutive notes with the same pitch.</p></li>
<li><p>E3. Any tonic-triad pitch may be inserted prior to the first pitch of a basic step motion in primary upper lines or between consecutive notes in any type of line, provided that no dissonant leap or leap larger than an octave occurs. (Note that a perfect fourth is a melodic consonance.) (In bass lines, insertion of scale degree 3 immediately prior to the final tonic should be avoided.)</p></li>
<li><p>E4. Any two consecutive notes forming a leap may be joined by step motion.</p></li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Global Rules for Elaborated Lines</strong></p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>G1. All of the pitches in a line should lie within a single register (i.e., within the span of a tenth or perhaps twelfth).</p></li>
<li><p>G2. The last two notes of a primary upper line must form a step.</p></li>
<li><p>G3. Lines in minor keys should conform to the melodic minor scale in the use of the sixth and seventh scale degrees. The lower neighbor of the tonic pitch is the raised seventh degree.</p></li>

<h2>First Species in Two Parts<a class="headerlink" href="#first-species-in-two-parts" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p><strong>Rules for Constructing the Lines</strong></p>
<ol class="arabic simple">
<li><p>Each line must be generated by the rules for constructing species lines.</p></li>
<li><p>The upper line must be a primary upper line.</p></li>
<li><p>The lower line must be a bass line.</p></li>
</ol>
<p><strong>Rules for Combining Lines</strong></p>
<p><em>Control of Dissonance</em></p>
<ol class="arabic simple">
<li><p>Two notes that sound simultaneously must not form a dissonant interval. (Remember that the fourth is a vertical dissonance.)</p></li>
</ol>
<p><em>Forbidden Forms of Motion</em></p>
<ol class="arabic simple">
<li><p>No parallel unisons, octaves, or fifths between consecutive simultaneities.</p></li>
<li><p>No non-consecutive parallel unisons or octaves that result from parallel structures in their lines, unless the intervening simultaneity includes a pitch dissonant with the first unison or octave.</p></li>
<li><p>No similar motion to or from a unison.</p></li>
<li><p>No similar motion to an octave unless both notes forming the octave are the final tonics in their respective basic structures and the upper note is approached by step.</p></li>
<li><p>No similar motion to a fifth unless the upper note is approached by step and is either the fifth or second scale degree.</p></li>
<li><p>No voice crossing, overlapping, or cross relations.</p></li>
<li><p>If the bass leaps a fourth, one of the two notes in the upper line that coincides with the two notes forming the fourth must form a second or a seventh with the contiguous (non-simultaneous) bass note.</p></li>
</ol>
<p><em>Sonority</em></p>
<ol class="arabic simple">
<li><p>Prefer imperfect consonances.</p></li>
<li><p>Prefer to use a fifth or octave in the midst of the composition only where the emphasis provided by that interval will help to stress a pitch that belongs to the background structure.</p></li>
<li><p>Avoid unisons except in the first and last measures.</p></li>
<li><p>Avoid intervals larger than a tenth.</p></li>

<p><strong>Rules for Constructing the Half-Note Line</strong></p>
<ol class="arabic simple">
<li><p>The half-note line may begin either on or off the beat, that is, it may begin with a half rest.</p></li>
<li><p>The last note in the line is a whole note initiated with the last note of the whole-note line.</p></li>
<li><p>The half-note line must not include any immediate repetitions.</p></li>
<li><p>Modification of the global rule for final step in a primary upper line. If the half-note line is a primary upper line with basic step motion, at least one note in the penul- timate bar of the line must be consonant and must lie a step away from the final tonic. If the step-related note is the first note in the penultimate bar, the second note must not displace it by step.</p></li>

<li><p>Localized rule E2 (L2).A neighbor may be inserted between a locally consonant pitch and its repetition. In minor, the lower neighbor to the diatonic or raised seventh degree, is the raised sixth degree; and the upper neighbor to the diatonic or raised sixth degree is the lowered seventh degree.</p></li>

<h2>First Species: Three Lines<a class="headerlink" href="#first-species-three-lines" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p><strong>Construction of Lines</strong></p>
<ol class="arabic simple">
<li><p>The lowest line must have the structure of a bass line.</p></li>
<li><p>One upper line, not necessarily the highest, must have a basic step motion.</p></li>
<li><p>The other upper line may have the structure of either a generic or primary upper line.</p></li>
</ol>
<p><strong>Rules for Combining Lines</strong></p>
<p><em>Control of Dissonance</em></p>
<ol class="arabic simple">
<li><p>No dissonance may be formed between simultaneous notes. (Though the fourth is a harmonic dissonance when formed between an upper voice and the bass, fourths between upper voices are considered consonant.) Exception: An augmented fourth or diminished fifth is allowed between the upper voices if the bass forms a sixth with one upper voice and a third with the other.</p></li>
</ol>
<p><em>Forbidden Forms of Motion</em></p>
<ol class="arabic simple">
<li><p>No parallel unisons, octaves or fifths between consec- utive notes in any pair of lines.</p></li>
<li><p>No non-consecutive parallel unisons or octaves unless the intervening simultaneity includes either (a) a pitch forming a second or seventh with the first unison or octave or (b) a member of the same pitch class as the pitches of the second unison or octave.</p></li>
<li><p>No similar motion to or from a unison.</p></li>
<li><p>No similar motion to an octave unless the upper note is approached by step and both notes forming the octave are the final tonics in their respective basic structures.</p></li>
<li><p>No similar motion to a fifth unless the upper note is approached by step and either the upper note is the fifth or second scale degree or the fifth is in the upper two voices and the bass note is a member of a different pitch class.</p></li>
<li><p>Leaps of a fourth in the bass: there must be a note in one of the upper lines that sounds simultaneously with one of the notes forming the fourth and creates a second or seventh with the other note forming the four th.</p></li>
<li><p>No voice crossing or overlapping between the bass and either upper line. The upper voices may cross or overlap so long as the structure of each line is clear.</p></li>
<li><p>No cross relations unless the third line moves by step at the same time that the second note of the cross relation occurs.</p></li>
</ol>
<p><em>Sonority</em></p>
<ol class="arabic simple">
<li><p>A sonority of three different pitch classes in each measure is most satisfactory. Where impossible or undesirable, use the next fullest sonority (two notes of one pitch class and a third forming an imperfect consonance with the other two).</p></li>
<li><p>Avoid simultaneities that form only perfect intervals except at the beginning and end.</p></li>
<li><p>The upper two voices should rarely be further than an octave apart.</p></li>
