Description: WesterParse
        ===========
        
        WesterParse implements the theory of tonal music presented in chapters 4-6 of 
        *An Introduction to Tonal Theory* (New York: Norton, 1975) by Peter Westergaard. 
        This portion of Westergaard's text develops a theory of species counterpoint for 
        classically tonal music. An innovative feature of the approach is the set of rules
        that define the closed tonal line. In effect, the line-generating rules implement
        Heinrich Schenker's concept of fundamental structure (*Ursatz*), together with a 
        repertory of ways for elaborating that structure. Westergaard was also interested in
        how the notes in one line interact with the notes in another, and he had many 
        interesting insights into how listeners use the rules as they negotiate the interpretation
        of two or more lines unfolding simultaneously. WesterParse already incorporates many
        of the cognitive preferences identified by Westergaard. The plan is ultimately to include 
        all of the preference rules as well as giving users the option of activating each rule.
        
        There are two main components to WesterParse: a *parser* that evaluates the structure of 
        musical lines used in species counterpoint, and a *checker* that evaluates the
        voice leading of species counterpoint compositions.
